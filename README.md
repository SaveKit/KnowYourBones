# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## How to Run This Project

1. **Install dependencies**: Run `npm install` to install all the necessary dependencies.
2. **Start the development server**: Run `npm run dev` to start the Vite development server.
3. **Open in browser**: Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5174` to see the application running.

For a production build, run `npm run build` and then `npm run serve` to preview the production build locally.
